LangChain Projects – Real-World AI Applications

This repository contains a collection of hands-on LangChain projects focused on building practical, real-world AI applications using Large Language Models (LLMs).

The projects demonstrate how LangChain can be used to:

Convert unstructured data into structured formats

Build AI-powered automation workflows

Integrate LLMs with Python applications

Create interactive web apps using Streamlit

Each project emphasizes practical implementation, clean code structure, and real-world use cases rather than theory.

🔧 Tech Stack: Python, LangChain, Gemini / LLMs, Streamlit, Pandas
🎯 Focus Areas: AI automation, data extraction, document processing, LLM-based applications
